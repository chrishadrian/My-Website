			"The App is called Unixpense and it is a simple expense tracker app that allows users to track their expenses by creating, deleting, saving, loading and analyzing their expense(s). Using Java, Java Swing, and JSON, I created an object-oriented graphical user interface application from end-to-end. I designed the object-oriented program (OOP) with Java, read and write the app's data with JSON, and created the graphical user interface (GUI) with Java Swing.",

The submitted data will then be transferred to the webpage, which was built by my other teammates that will display users' statistics over the week. I did this project during HackTheNorth 2021, the largest hackathon in North America.",
